# Education

I earned my PhD (2020) and MS (2015) in Computer Science from Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA, and I earned my BE (2013) in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Technical University, Bhopal, MP, India.
\
My research lies at the intersection of deep feature learning and local feature engineering with a focus on discovering and leveraging feature saliency through localized feature extraction, deep feature learning (hyper-parameter search, network sparsification, and attention networks) with key application in multi-variate time series analysis.

# Work

I am currently working as a Staff Data Scientist in the Emerging Tech Group in Walmart Global Tech. Previously, I was working as Machine Learning Researcher (Research Scientist) in Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (AIRLab) at Nokia Bell Labs and I am based on Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA. Previously, I interned as a Data Science Inters at Bell Labs, where I worked on automated representation learning for streaming data, and at Eaton Corporation, where I worked on extremely high-dimensional time series forecasting on real-world IoT networks.
