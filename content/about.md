Welcome to the home page of Yash Garg.

# Education
I earned my PhD (2020) and MS (2015) in Computer Science from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ. I have earned my BE (2013) in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Technical University, Bhopal, MP, India.
\
My research lies at the intersection of deep feature learning and local feature engineering with a focus on discovering and leveraging feature saliency through localized feature extraction, deep feature learning (hyper-parameter search, network sparsification, and attention networks) with key application in multi-variate time series analysis ([More](/research/)).

# Work
I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher (Member of Technical Staff) at Nokia Bell Labs in the Artificial Intelligence Research Labs (AIRLab). Previously, I interned as a Data Scientist at Bell Labs, where I worked on automated representation learning for streaming data, and at Eaton Corporation, where I worked on extremely high-dimensional time series forecasting on real-world IoT networks ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashgarg1232?utm_source=homepage)).
