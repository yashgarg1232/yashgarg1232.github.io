Welcome to the home page of Yash Garg.

# Education
I have a PhD (2020) and MS (2015) in Computer Science from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.
I have earned my BE (2013) in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Technical University,
Bhopal, MP, India.

My research lies at the intersection of deep neural networks and time series
analysis, with a focus on discovering and leveraging feature saliency through
localized feature extraction, deep feature learning (hyper-parameter search,
network sparsification, and attention networks). [More here](/research/)
# Work
I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher (Member of Technical Staff)
at Nokia Bell Labs in the Artificial Intelligence Research Labs (AIRLab).
Previously I interned as a Data Scientist at Bell Labs, where his work on
automated representation learning for streaming time series successfully led to
a patent, and at Eaton Corporation, where he focused on extremely high-dimensional
stream forecasting.
